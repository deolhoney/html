CAD development project discuss the work done in computer-aided-design. Computer-aided
design (CAD) is the use of computer systems to assist in the creation, modification, analysis, or
optimization of a design.I explored OpenSCAD source code. OpenSCAD is Free and Open Source
CAD Software. OpenSCAD is a fully comprehensive 3D CAD application that you can download
and install for free. There is a large base of satisfied OpenSCAD users worldwide, and it is available
in more than 20 languages and for all major operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Mac
OS X and Linux (De- bian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Mandriva, Suse ...). OpenSCAD is an application for
Computer Aided Design (CAD) in three dimensions (3d).
OpenSCAD is a software for creating solid 3D CAD objects. It is free software and available for
Linux/UNIX, MS Windows and Apples OS X. Unlike most free software for creating 3D models
(such as the famous application Blender) it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling
but instead on the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for when you
are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure is not what you are looking
for when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies. OpenSCAD is not an
interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that
describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file (see examples below). This
gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process and enables you to easily change
any step in the modelling process or make designes that are defined by configurable parameters.
Also, this project makes this Project 3D model of Water Tank.In this project, the user will be
able to enter the specifications of the Water Tank through the web browser using Django (Python
Web Framework) and on the back-end, the OpenSCAD will use those input values to Draw the
Water Tank for certain parametric and in this by filling a dimmension of a water tank by the user
on a web browser and he/she will obtain a zip file on a browser then a user can download that zip
file from a browser and unzip that file and open that file in a OpenSCAD. when this file is open
by the user in an OpenSCAD then hs to be/she has to be render that file with a function key (f5).
The output that can be taken has format .scad.
This project is completely open source and the entire code is available to the user as and when
required. There is also Complete developerâ€™s Documentation as well as User manual along with it
that helps using it a lot easier.
