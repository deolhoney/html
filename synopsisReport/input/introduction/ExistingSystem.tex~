\section{The Existing System}
In Past the people were spending their alot of a very usefull time for writing a code to make a
WaterTank in different size. But know I made in a specification Form in which a user can put a
values in it according to the dimension he/she needed. By this the user time will be saved he/she
can use this usefull time in an other important thing.
 Limitations of previous system
\begin {enumerate} 
\item• No batch mode
\item• Complex workflow
\item• Not open-source (User not modified the software)
\item• They need installation and a lot of system resources
\item• Platform dependent
\item• You could only put the dimension then the drawing will automatically in the front of you.
\end{enumerate}
